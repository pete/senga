Senga draws lines.  That's it.  If what you want is some lines drawn and to do
the rest yourself using RMagick, then this may be what you want.

Nobody ever checks the RDoc any more because nobody writes RDoc any more.  Here
is an example if you haven't checked the RDoc:

	require 'prime'
	png = Senga.graph(:bgcolor => 'white', :xscale => 10, :yscale => 10) { |g|
		g.plot('green', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 5)
		g.plot('red', [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13], 6)
		g.plot('blue', Prime.take(7), 4)
		g.plot('black', (1..7).map { rand 10 }, 1)
	}.to_blob
	# And if you feel like doing some additional processing, like overlaying
	# the graph on top of an image or something, do that before calling to_blob.
	(File.open('graph.png', 'w') << png).close

See the doc/ directory for additional information.
